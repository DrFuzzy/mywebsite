	abstract = {This paper presents a 2D Delaunay triangulation core for surface reconstruction implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip. The core implementation is derived using high-level synthesis from a C++ description of an incremental 2D Delaunay triangulation algorithm. This description was modified accordingly so that it can be embedded into a FPGA chip using hardware description language. Goal of this work is to increase the execution speed of the algorithm so as to allow for real-time operation. Towards this end, we performed an optimization process using high level synthesis directives which pipeline regions of the code in order to achieve delay optimization. We show preliminary results using standard benchmark models for surface reconstruction, which show the performance of our design.},

  abstract={In large networks due to the large number of transmissions it is unlikely that a slot will be used only by a single wireless node. In this paper, a Cutting Plane approach is proposed in order to combine the minimum latency transmission scheduling problem with power expenditure minimization. The problem is partitioned into a Master Problem and a Subproblem; the main objective of the Subproblem is to minimize the total power expenditure. The Cutting Plane algorithm used is evaluated with regard to its performance and the outcome is that the power expenditure is reduced significantly, while achieving the minimum latency transmission scheduling. One of the drawbacks of the proposed approach, however, is the fact that although it reduces the power significantly, the computational time required is quite large, pointing to further research towards that direction.},

    abstract = {In order to alleviate interference and contention in a wireless network, we may exploit the existence of multiple orthogonal channels or time slots, thus achieving a substantial improvement in performance. In this paper, we study a joint transmission scheduling and power control problem that arises in wireless networks. The goal is to assign channels (orâ€‰timeâ€‰slots) and transmitting powers to communication links such that all communication requests are processed correctly, specified quality-of-service requirements are met, and the number of required time slots is minimised. First, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming. Then, we show that the problem considered is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard, and subsequently, we propose non-trivial bounding techniques to solve it. Optimisation methods are also discussed, including a column generation approach, specifically designed to find bounds for the transmission scheduling problem. Moreover, we develop optimisation techniques in which the bounding techniques are integrated in order to derive the optimal solution to the problem faster. We close with an extensive computational study, which shows that despite the complexity of the problem, the proposed methodology scales to problems of non-trivial size. Our algorithms can therefore be used for static wireless networks where propagation conditions are almost constant and a centralised agent is available (e.g. cellular networks where the base station can act as a centralised agent or wireless mesh networks), and they can also serve as a benchmark for the performance evaluation of heuristic, approximation or distributed algorithms that aim to find near-optimal solutions without information about the whole network.},

	abstract = {We present robust dynamic resource allocation mechanisms to allocate application resources meeting Service Level Objectives (SLOs) agreed between cloud providers and customers. In fact, two filter-based robust controllers, i.e. \${\textbackslash}mathcalH\_Ä±nfty\$ filter and Maximum Correntropy Criterion Kalman filter (MCC-KF), are proposed. The controllers are self-adaptive, with process noise variances and covariances calculated using previous measurements within a time window. In the allocation process, a bounded client mean response time (mRT) is maintained. Both controllers are deployed and evaluated on an experimental testbed hosting the RUBiS (Rice University Bidding System) auction benchmark web site. The proposed controllers offer improved performance under abrupt workload changes, shown via rigorous comparison with current state-of-the-art. On our experimental setup, the Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) controllers can operate on the same server where the resource allocation is performed; while Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) controllers are on a separate server where all the data are collected for decision making. SISO controllers take decisions not dependent to other system states (servers), albeit MIMO controllers are characterized by increased communication overhead and potential delays. While SISO controllers offer improved performance over MIMO ones, the latter enable a more informed decision making framework for resource allocation problem of multi-tier applications.},

	abstract = {Virtualized servers have been the key for the efficient deployment of cloud applications. As the application demand increases, it is important to dynamically adjust the CPU allocation of each component in order to save resources for other applications and keep performance high, e.g., the client mean response time (mRT) should be kept below a Quality of Service (QoS) target. In this work, a new form of Kalman filter, called the Maximum Correntropy Criterion Kalman Filter (MCC-KF), has been used in order to predict, and hence, adjust the CPU allocations of each component while the RUBiS auction site workload changes randomly as the number of clients varies. MCC-KF has shown high performance when the noise is non-Gaussian, as it is the case in the CPU usage. Numerical evaluations compare our designed framework with other current state-of-the-art using real-data via the RUBiS benchmark website deployed on a prototype Xen-virtualized cluster.},

In contrast with the bank-estimators approach the proposed i-FD unit is using only one estimator for multiple sensor fault detection.

When evaluating the performance of the proposed controller it is demonstrated that it provides even better performance than the filters it is trained on. In addition, there are no assumptions on the noise characteristics and due to the fact that the neuro-fuzzy controller can, in general, capture non-linear level processes, our controller is more robust than linear model based approaches, such as the Kalman and the Hâˆž filters.},

Traditionally model-based fault-tolerant/detection units for multiple sensor faults in automation require a bank of estimators, normally Kalman-based ones. An AI-based control framework enabling low computational power fault tolerance is presented. Contrary to the bank-of-estimators approach, the proposed framework exhibits a single unit for multiple actuator/sensor fault detection.

	abstract = {The research and development of autonomous vehicle has entered the era of commercialization. While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI). A preliminary investigation of a new autonomous vehicle validation infrastructure that can serve a multitude of research projects for smart city is presented.},

We design a Kalman filter that manages intermittent observations in order to handle and fuse the readings and estimate the pose of the quadrotor for tracking a predefined trajectory. The system is implemented via a Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation technique, in which the dynamic model of the quadrotor is simulated in an open-source 3D robotics simulator tool, and the whole navigation system is implemented on Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled edge GPU. The simulation results show that our proposed framework offers low positioning and trajectory errors, while handling intermittent sensor measurements.},

The framework integrates sensor readings from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a camera-based object detection algorithm, and an Ultra-WideBand (UWB) localisation system. Often the sensor readings are not always readily available, leading to inaccurate pose estimation and hence poor navigation performance. To effectively handle and fuse sensor readings, and accurately estimate the pose of the quadrotor for tracking a predefined trajectory, we design a Maximum Correntropy Criterion Kalman Filter (MCC-KF) that can manage intermittent observations. The MCC-KF is designed to improve the performance of the estimation process when is done with a Kalman Filter (KF), since KFs are likely to degrade dramatically in practical scenarios in which noise is non-Gaussian (especially when the noise is heavy-tailed). To evaluate the performance of the MCC-KF, we compare it with a previously designed Kalman filter by the authors. Through this comparison, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCC-KF in handling indoor navigation missions. The simulation results show that our presented framework offers low positioning errors, while effectively handling intermittent sensor measurements.},

	abstract = {Delaunay triangulation is an effective way to build a triangulation of a cloud of points, i.e., a partitioning of the points into simplices (triangles in 2D, tetrahedra in 3D, and so on), such that no two simplices overlap and every point in the set is a vertex of at least one simplex. Such a triangulation has been shown to have several interesting properties in terms of the structure of the simplices it constructs (e.g., maximising the minimum angle of the triangles in the bi-dimensional case) and has several critical applications in the contexts of computer graphics, computational geometry, mobile robotics or indoor localisation, to name a few application domains. This review paper revolves around three main pillars: (I) algorithms, (II) implementations over central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and (III) applications. Specifically, the paper provides a comprehensive review of the main state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches to compute the Delaunay Triangulation. Subsequently, it delivers a critical review of implementations of Delaunay triangulation over CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Finally, the paper covers a broad and multi-disciplinary range of possible applications of this technique.},
